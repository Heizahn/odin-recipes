    <h2>Decryption</h2>
    <p>Million dollar spaghetti is the perfect combination of noodles, lean ground beef sauce, cottage cheese, cream
        cheese, and sour cream. It's unbelievably good! Serve with garlic bread and salad.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti: An 8-ounce package of spaghetti should make about eight servings.</li>
        <li>Beef: Youâ€™ll need a pound of lean ground beef. You can use a mix of ground beef and ground turkey, if you
            prefer.</li>
        <li>Spaghetti sauce: Use a jar of store-bought spaghetti sauce or make your own marinara sauce at home.</li>
        <li>Butter: Use a stick of sliced butter to prepare the pan and to add richness and flavor to the baked
            spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream: A mixture of cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream is
            essential for this decadent, creamy spaghetti sauce.</li>
        <li>Cheese: Shredded Cheddar cheese is the perfect finishing touch for this million dollar spaghetti.</li>
